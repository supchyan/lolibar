#### <div align=center>lolibar | statusbar for Windows [ 10, 11 ] | C#</div>

## ü™ºIntroduction
This project is **toolkit** for modders, which grants capabilities to create statusbars. There're no `ready-to-use` executable on **[Releases](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/releases)** page, so if you want to gain one, you can configure it using this toolkit!

## ü™ºAlternatives
- **[yasb](https://github.com/da-rth/yasb) (Cross platform, Python)**
- **[polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) (Linux, C++)**
- **[eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) (Linux, Rust)**
- **[ironbar](https://github.com/JakeStanger/ironbar) (Linux, Rust)**

## ü™ºPre-requirements
All modding operations is highly recommended to do in `Visual Studio 2022`. Moreover, to build this project, you have to install `.NET8.0 SDK`. Actually, you can use other `.net sdks` as well, but `main branch` targets to `.net8.0`, so any issues with different `.net` versions you have to solve locally.

## ü™ºModding Basics
Have you ever tried to write mods for video games? So, this toolkit provides the same vibes:
```csharp
namespace LolibarApp.Mods;

class ExampleEmptyMod : LolibarMod
{
    public override void PreInitialize()
    {
        // Put your Pre-Initialization code here...
    }
    public override void Initialize()
    {
        // Put your Initialization code here...
    }
    public override void Update()
    {
        // Put your Updatable code here...
    }
}
```
As you can see, this file looks familiar with any other mod body. You can handle every single part of Lolibar's libraries here!

## ü™ºYour First mod
> [!TIP]
> All mods is highly recommended to be stored in **[Mods](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/tree/master/Mods/)** folder.

The first step of your modding journey is **creating a mod class**. Let's get into `MyFirstMod.cs`:
```cs
namespace LolibarApp.Mods;

class MyFirstMod : LolibarMod
{
    public override void PreInitialize() { }
    public override void Initialize() { }
    public override void Update() { }
}
```
All you can see above is **absolute minimum** your mod must contain. Without that, Lolibar won't compile properly. Let's talk about every part in details. </br></br>

```cs
namespace LolibarApp.Mods;
```
`namespace` have to be set as `LolibarApp.Mods` unless you want to prevent your mod from being detected by `ModLoader`. </br></br>

```cs
public override void PreInitialize() { }
```
`PreInitialize()` hook useful to initialize something before `Initialize()` hook invoked, so its pre-initialization. I recommend you to setup all properties in there. What is `properties`? Let's talk about them, referencing to **[LolibarProperties](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/blob/master/Source/Tools/LolibarProperties.cs)** class:
```cs
// Properties stores values, which uses in Lolibar's resources.
// It can be anything, starting from styles, such as Main Color (BarColor),
// ending with triggers, simulating or providing something.

// Basic example:
public override void PreInitialize()
{
    BarUpdateDelay            = 250;
    BarHeight                 = 36;
    BarColor                  = LolibarHelper.SetColor("#2a3247");
    BarContainersContentColor = LolibarHelper.SetColor("#6f85bd");
}
```
This example overrides `4` different properties, which will be applied to all Lolibar's components including Lolibar itself during initialization process. </br></br>

```cs
public override void Initialize() { }
```
`Initialize()` hook is about to **initialize** something on application's launch. The most common usage is **initialization of the containers**. What is `container`? Let's get into it, referencing to **[LolibarContainer](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/blob/master/Source/Tools/LolibarContainer.cs)** class:
```cs
// All "Buttons" / "Data Fields" inside your statusbar
// have to be generated by LolibarContainer class.
// This class automatically does job of formatting,
// structing and comparing content inside specified components.
// So that component's Frankenstein can be called simply - `Container`.

// How to create one, using LolibarContainer class:
public override void Initialize()
{
    LolibarContainer HelloContainer = new()
    {
        Name          = "HelloContainer",
        Parent        = Lolibar.BarCenterContainer,
        Text          = "Hello!",
        HasBackground = true
    };
    HelloContainer.Create();
}
```

*<div align=center>Result of the initialization process we can observe after Lolibar's launch.</div>*
</br>

Here we can see a new object instance, that has a couple of local properties inside. Let me explain about those, which certain example has:
* `Name` - Initial container name. Uses for automatic resources initialization;
* `Parent` - Any other container, where this should be placed;
* `Text` - Text content of the container;
* `HasBackground` - Trigger to draw border around the container. It's semi-transparent and fits well with the whole statusbar theme. 

We've drawn a static container. Now, let's update it's content, using `Update()` hook:
```cs
public override void Update() { }
```
This hook is about to **update** something along statusbar's execution process. `Update()` hook has an **Update Delay** - time span, between loop iterations. Yes, `Update()` is an infinite loop hook, so keep it in mind. The interations delay can be modified by `BarUpdateDelay` property, which can be setup in `PreInitialize()` hook as well. To understand `Update()`'s principles better, check **[Examples](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/tree/master/Mods/Examples)** section. By the way, **[Examples](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/tree/master/Mods/Examples)** section is **great start point** in your modding journey, because it has various examples of how to create one or other thing. Anyway, let's get back into updating info in `HelloContainer`:
```cs
using LolibarApp.Source.Tools;
using LolibarApp.Source;

namespace LolibarApp.Mods;

class MyFirstMod : LolibarMod
{
    // I've made it external to get access to it from other hook.
    LolibarContainer HelloContainer;

    public override void PreInitialize() { }
    public override void Initialize()
    {
        HelloContainer = new()
        {
            Name = "HelloContainer",
            Parent = Lolibar.BarCenterContainer,
            Text = "Hello!",
            HasBackground = true
        };
        HelloContainer.Create();
    }
    public override void Update() 
    {
        HelloContainer.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString();   // Change instance's text content ...
        HelloContainer.Update();                         // ... And update it in resources

        // Now, text inside `HelloContainer` will be updated to the current system's time every `BarUpdateDelay`.
    }
}
// Simple enough, isn't it? üê≥
