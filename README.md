> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project is **toolkit** for developers, which grants capabilities to create statusbars, so there is no `ready-to-use` executable on **[Releases](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/releases)** page. If you want one, you can build it by yourself.
> 
> This project is for **Windows Platform** only! Please, check **[polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)** repo, if you're looking for the Linux one.

### üéüÔ∏èPre-requirements
All modding operations is highly recommended to do in `Visual Studio 2022`. Moreover, to build this project, you have to install `.NET8.0 SDK`. Actually, you can use other `.net sdks` as well, but `main branch` targets to `.net8.0`, so any issues with different `.net` versions you have to solve locally.

### üéüÔ∏èModding understanding
Have you ever tried to write mods for the video games? So, this toolkit provides the same vibes.
```csharp
namespace LolibarApp.Mods;

class ExampleEmptyMod : LolibarMod
{
    public override void PreInitialize()
    {
        // Put your Pre-Initialization here...
    }
    public override void Initialize()
    {
        // Put your Initialization here...
    }
    public override void Update()
    {
        // Put your Updates here...
    }
}
```
As you can see, this file looks similar to any other mod body. You can handle every single part of Lolibar's libraries here!

#### Your First mod
> [!TIP]
> All mods is highly recommended to be stored in **[Mods](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/tree/master/Mods/)** folder.

First step of your modding is **create mod class**. Let's get into `MyFirstMod.cs`:
```cs
namespace LolibarApp.Mods;

class MyFirstMod : LolibarMod
{
    public override void PreInitialize() { }
    public override void Initialize() { }
    public override void Update() { }
}
```
All you can see above is **absolute minimum** your mod must contain. Without that, Lolibar won't compile properly. Let's talk about every part in details:
```cs
namespace LolibarApp.Mods;
```
`namespace` have to be set as `LolibarApp.Mods` unless you want to prevent your mod from being detected by `ModLoader`.
```cs
public override void PreInitialize() { }
```
`PreInitialize()` this hook uses to initialize something before `Initialize()` hook invoked. I recommend to setup all properties in there. What is `properties`? Let's talk about **[LolibarProperties](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/blob/master/Source/Tools/LolibarProperties.cs)** class:
```cs
// Properties stores values, which uses in Lolibar's resources.
// It can be anything, starting from styles, such as Main Color (BarColor),
// ending with triggers, simulates or provides something.

// Basic example:
public override void PreInitialize()
{
    BarUpdateDelay = 250;
    BarHeight = 36;
    BarColor = LolibarHelper.SetColor("#2a3247");
    BarContainersContentColor = LolibarHelper.SetColor("#6f85bd");
}
```
This example overrides `4` different properties, which will be loaded into all Lolibar's components including Lolibar itself on `Initialize()` hook.
```cs
public override void Initialize() { }
```
This hook is about **initialize** something on application launch. Most common usage is containers initialization. What is `container`? Let's note **[LolibarContainer](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/blob/master/Source/Tools/LolibarContainer.cs)** class:
```cs
// All "Buttons" / "Data Fields" inside your statusbar generated by LolibarContainer class
// and named simply - Containers.

// How to create one:
public override void Initialize()
{
    LolibarContainer HelloContainer = new()
    {
        Name          = "HelloContainer",
        Parent        = Lolibar.BarCenterContainer,
        Text          = "Hello!",
        HasBackground = true
    };
    HelloContainer.Create();
}
```
<div align=center><img src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50082bfd-b780-421f-b621-3a807c39f8ac /></div>

Here we can see new object instance, which has couple of data inside. This certain example has:
* `Name` - Initial container name. Uses in auto-generated resources initialization;
* `Parent` - Some other container, where this should be placed;
* `Text` - Text content of the container;
* `HasBackground` - Trigger to draw border around the container. It's semi-transparent and fits well with whole statusbar theme.

We have drawn static container with no logic inside. But we can fix this issue! Let's use final hook in mod class:
```cs
public override void Update() { }
```
This hook is about to **update** something while statusbar execution process. To understand it principles and restictions, check **[Examples](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/tree/master/Mods/Examples)** section. Examples section also good to start modding, because it has various examples of how to make one or other thing. Anyway, let's update info in our `HelloContainer`:
```cs
class MyMod : LolibarMod
{
    LolibarContainer HelloContainer;
    public override void PreInitialize() { }
    public override void Initialize()
    {
        HelloContainer = new()
        {
            Name = "HelloContainer",
            Parent = Lolibar.BarCenterContainer,
            Text = "Hello!",
            HasBackground = true
        };
        HelloContainer.Create();
    }
    public override void Update() 
    {
        HelloContainer.Text = "I like whales!"; // Update instance text content ...
        HelloContainer.Update();                // ... And load it into resources
    }
}
// Simple enough, isn't it? üê≥

Inspired to start modding? Get into **[Examples](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/tree/master/Mods/Examples)** section to learn more about Lolibar's capabilities.

### üéüÔ∏èSomething about `LolibarApp.csproj`
To compile this project, you have to set valid `TargetFramework` for your system in **[LolibarApp.csproj](https://github.com/supchyan/lolibar/blob/master/LolibarApp.csproj)** </br>
As an example of this source, for Windows 11 it should be set to `net8.0-windows10.0.22000.0`. </br>
You can read **[this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-enhance)** article on Microsoft Learn to find out, which `TargetFramework` is for you.
```csproj
Ôªø<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows10.0.22000.0</TargetFramework>
        ...other tags
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
